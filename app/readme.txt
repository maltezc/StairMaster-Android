Using a RecyclerView has the following key steps:

2. Define a model class to use as the data source
3. Add a RecyclerView to your activity to display the items
4. Create a custom row layout XML file to visualize the item
5. Create a RecyclerView.Adapter and ViewHolder to render the item
6. Bind the adapter to the data source to populate the RecyclerView
